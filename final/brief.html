                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>For the final project, I intend to iterate the Game On! studio project by adding a multiplayer option, creating more graphics and animations, and giving users the ability to change the settings of the game.</p>          
             </div>
             <div class="content">
                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>For the user interactions, I want to add more animations when the user starts a new day or gives their plant resources. When the user starts a new day, I want to add an animation that mimics a calendar flipping so that there is both a visual and aural change that the day has passed. Depending on the scope of the graphics and audio, I would like to include additional indicators of which resources are changing by using animations and sound effects that correspond to each type of resource. I also want to add a settings page so that the user can adjust the inputs and also remove the visual and aural interactions if they prefer that.

                <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
                <p>For the visual strategies, I want to keep the more natural earth tones color scheme of the Game, but I would also like to improve the overall look by adding more texture so that the game’s design is more friendly. I also want to adjust the design of the health overlay so that it indicates the optimal range of each resource so that users can have a better understanding of the game’s logic. I also want to create more consistency between the game’s visual output (the plant) and the user input. The current design separates the visual output and input into two separate sections without creating a strong visual link between the two. This would create a more cohesive game overall and would also make it easier to create a responsive game for mobile screens, where the visual output and input are more visually separated.

                <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
                <p>For the user experience, I want to add more flexibility to the gameplay by including a settings overlay. This section would allow the user to adjust the game from single-player to two-player mode, introducing friendly competition instead of just a survival game. I also plan on expanding the plant’s health overlay. First by making the overlay persistent instead of a simple hover interaction so that the information is available all throughout the gameplay. I also plan on adding the option of different plant types, each with a different range of optimal resource levels. This introduces more variability and difficulty levels to the game, creating a better user experience for a wider audience.
