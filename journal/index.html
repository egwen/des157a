                    Forms are a primary method for websites to interact with users, so it is essential that forms are simple and straightforward, following the concept of “Less is More”. A form's simple design reflects the amount of information and effort required of the user and increases the likelihood that they interact with and complete the form. Both the quantity and quality of the form's inputs determines the usability of the form.

                <p>
                    The overall form's structure should have minimal content and keep a simple layout to increase usability. The most basic approach to simplify a form is to minimize the number of inputs. However, in cases where the form must be long, designers should visually communicate the number of steps required so users know what to expect and are more likely to complete the form. The form should also progress from simple to complex questions so that users are less likely to abandon the form at the very beginning. The layout of the form should also maintain vertical visual flow with single columns. This reduces both the amount of vertical scrolling and avoids horizontal interruptions to the user's progress. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each individual input field should also have a simple design with enough information for the user to understand the expected input. Labels and placeholder text are crucial components of information so users can fill out the form quickly without any mistakes. They should be placed close to the input field and should persist as the user types, especially for longer forms. Designers should also consider input type to optimize user navigation speed. Inputs that require multiple interactions can become tedious for users, decreasing usability.

                    An webite that follows some of these practices is <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, which uses forms in their lessons. The form uses select input types to avoid user frustration and progress bars to indicate the length of the form, increasing the likelihood that learners complete their lesson.
