                    A successful game's design should keep users engaged and provide an enjoyable experience, while also improving monetization. The best practices for game design are proven by data to improve user engagement and experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In mobile games, the likelihood of a user interacting with elements is influenced by its position and layout on the screen. Depending on the screen size and orientation, users are more likely to interact with elements positioned closer to the lower right-hand side of the screen. Therefore, designers often place interactive elements that lead to monetization or further engagement in these areas of the screen. Designers also use sliders, which makes content available beyond the mobile screen size. However, the best practice for sliders is to use animations or partially visible elements to indicate that there is more content available off-screen. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another game component that is useful for catching the user's attention are pop-ups. However, pop-ups should follow a standard format to avoid annoying users. Similar to overlays for web pages, popups should be closely associated with its trigger element and have a semi-transparent background so users understand the connection between the popup and the main content. The buttons for pop-ups should be more positive, like “OK” instead of an “X”, and placed to the bottom-right of the pop-up since players gravitate towards that portion of the screen. Another way of engaging users and monetizing their time is rewarding ads with in-game prizes. Successfully balancing game prizes with ads keeps users engaged and motivates them to watch ads without annoying users. Other popups like “Rate us” or “Store” dialogs should be appropriately placed and timed so that users are less likely to immediately close the dialog. Using engaging presenters or bright colors and animations can also increase the probability of getting better ratings or monetizing the game.

                    This image was taken on a reusable film camera when I took my hometown friends on a tour of Davis. Even though my friend was biking and could not see the photo's preview, she still captured a visually interesting composition. The image visually focuses on the two figures at each third intersection and naturally leads into the picture towards some unknown destination. In that moment, I was actually very lost and pretending to confidently lead the way, hoping for the best. The nature of film allowed us to enjoy the moment without worrying if we were in the frame or where we were headed. The photos for this project are a collection of moments captured during the pandemic when my friends and I managed to spend time together without worrying about the state of the world.

                    This image appears to capture two friends enjoying a bike ride, likely around sunset. They seem to be biking through a parking lot, removed from any traffic. The location and destination are unknown from the photo, but the interesting aspect of the image is the subjects. The visual focus of a selfie is typically the people in the photo, since the photographer fills the frame and is the closest to the camera. Even though the second subject is in the background and less in focus, the shared experience of biking connects the foreground and background together. The clearest aspect of the photo is that two friends are enjoying a bike ride together while the destination of the ride and the relationship between the subjects remains mysterious.

                    Analyzing images and media through different lenses requires as much practice as reading and analyzing text. Images require visual literacy, a practice of methodically breaking down the details and connections of an image in order to question the overall message it conveys. Building visual literacy takes slow and precise practice, which is difficult in the oversaturated internet.

                    A website that uses interesting image and video interaction is <a href="https://lights.lu/" target="_blank">Lights</a>. This simplistic website combines videos and user hover interactions to display their work and create a more engaging footer. While many websites autoplay videos to summarize their work or product, this website inverts the colors of the video wherever the user hovers, engaging the user in an interesting way. Their work is heavily based on film and immersive shows. Even the footer is enhanced to reflect their brand and expose the user to even more of their work.

                <h2>Overlays Design</h2>
                <h3>Best Practices for Overlays</h3>
                <p class="date">7 Feburary 2023</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    An overlay is an element that displays on top of the main window's content. Overlays are a way to simplify a webpage's UI and draw the user's focus to important information and interactions. Overlays typically disable the entire window and require user interaction to proceed. However, since overlays force the user to do something, if they are not used in the appropriate context with the proper layout, they can become tedious and annoying for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The appropriate purpose of an overlay would be to show the user important or additional information. The best overlays only have vital information or prompt the user to input information required for the website's functionality. An example of appropriate content for an overlay would be a user's login and password, since that information is typically required for a website to fully function. Another appropriate context would be to provide additional content or information to the user without leaving the original page. For example, an overlay can be used to enlarge an image or video without leaving the original page. An overlay should have appropriate content to reduce the likelihood that users immediately dismiss the element or leave the page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designers should also consider effective UX principles so that users are more likely to interact with the overlay. The overlay should have a descriptive title so that the user understands the purpose of the element and its relation to the original page. Any buttons on the overlay should have labels that clearly reflect the purpose of the element. Since overlays disable the entire page, users should also be able to easily close the element by either a mouse or keyboard interaction. Overlays should also implement web accessibility principles like keyboard accessibility and ARIA tags. An overlay's design should be clear and understandable to users to reduce frustration and the likelihood that they dismiss the overlay completely.

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                <p class="date">31 January 2023</p>
            </div>

                    Forms are a primary method for websites to interact with users, so it is essential that forms are simple and straightforward, following the concept of “Less is More”. A form's simple design reflects the amount of information and effort required of the user and increases the likelihood that they interact with and complete the form. Both the quantity and quality of the form's inputs determines the usability of the form. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overall form's structure should have minimal content and keep a simple layout to increase usability. The most basic approach to simplify a form is to minimize the number of inputs. However, in cases where the form must be long, designers should visually communicate the number of steps required so users know what to expect and are more likely to complete the form. The form should also progress from simple to complex questions so that users are less likely to abandon the form at the very beginning. The layout of the form should also maintain vertical visual flow with single columns. This reduces both the amount of vertical scrolling and avoids horizontal interruptions to the user's progress. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each individual input field should also have a simple design with enough information for the user to understand the expected input. Labels and placeholder text are crucial components of information so users can fill out the form quickly without any mistakes. They should be placed close to the input field and should persist as the user types, especially for longer forms. Designers should also consider input type to optimize user navigation speed. Inputs that require multiple interactions can become tedious for users, decreasing usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An webite that follows some of these practices is <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, which uses forms in their lessons. The form uses select input types to avoid user frustration and progress bars to indicate the length of the form, increasing the likelihood that learners complete their lesson.
